# Description
This repository contains information about the pycover.py script which is used to process gcov based code coverage results.

# File Format Descriptions
GCov utilizes two different file formats in the processing of code coverage information.  GCov uses a 'Notes' file or '.gcno' file to record information about the branches, arcs and blocks that are associate with a source file and a 'Data' file or '.gcda' file.  There is also a third file format '.info' file which is historically generated by 'geninfo' and processed by 'lcov' in order to be able to generate code coverage reports.

The 'pycover.py' script can perform the function of geninfo and process data sources from varying locations in order to generate a '.info' file that combines all the information captured for a given code coverage run.  The 'pycover.py' script can then also process the '.info' file in order to create HTML reports that show detailed information about the coverage associated with the captured code coverage data.

The following section describes the '.gcno' and '.gcda' that the 'pycover.py' script consumes in order to generate the intermediate '.info' file and also describes the format of the '.info' file that it processes in order to create the HTML coverage report.
